# ControllerFramework
Controller framework for sensor-based applications on Arduino boards providing logging, configuration prameters, state-machines, etc.

## Dependencies
The framework requires the following libraries to be installed to the libraries folder of the sketchbook of your Arduino workbench:
* ArduinoUnit version >= 2.1 (TODO How to install)
* Adafruit_FRAM_I2C version >= 1.0 (TODO How to install)

**Note**: The fact that libraries are installed into the Arduino workbench does not imply that these libraries are included in the sketch uploaded to the Arduino board.

## Using the Controller Framework
